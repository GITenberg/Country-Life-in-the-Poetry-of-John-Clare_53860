<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>PART
I<br />
Economic Conditions in the Time of Clare</h2>
<p>About forty years before the birth of the Poet Clare, (1793)
there began in England a land revolution which by the end of the
eighteenth century pauperized a great part of the rural
population.&nbsp; Up until 1750 fully half of the land of England
was worked in &ldquo;common&rdquo;, or in accordance with what
was known as the open field system.&nbsp; This open field system
means that there were special fields set aside for plow
land.&nbsp; These fields were divided into very small strips
which were alternately cultivated and left unplowed.&nbsp;
Besides this plow land, there was a definite area of grazing
land, known as the commons.&nbsp; With the coming of enclosures
this open field system was abolished.&nbsp; (By the term
&lsquo;enclosure&rsquo; is meant that all the strips of any one
man scattered throughout the holdings of the village were given
to him in equivalent in a single, consolidated acreage, which he
had to fence, ditch, etc.&nbsp; Or again, the term applies to a
large district, as very frequently the commons, that was fenced
in for the wealthy landowner&rsquo;s sheep-pens.)</p>
<p>An enclosure began with a private bill introduced into
Parliament&mdash;often by a wealthy landlord.&nbsp; This bill,
showing the advantages of enclosing, was sent to a committee,
whose leader or chairman might have been the selfsame landlord
who had proposed the bill.&nbsp; After being considered and
passed <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>upon
by the house of lords, which was in turn composed of wealthy
landowners only, the bill was put into the hands of a commission
to be executed.&nbsp; Such a commission, perhaps headed by the
nobleman wanting the enclosure, descended upon the district and
distributed the land according to their wishes.</p>
<p>Enclosures no doubt increased the national wealth immensely in
the long run.&nbsp; Of course, no modern system of farming could
survive in which an acre was divided into ten or more strips each
with a different crop and different owner.&nbsp; And modern
methods were just then being introduced into England, and were
finding an obstacle in the old system that was almost identical
with the Anglo-Saxon system of a thousand years earlier.&nbsp;
But the change was too rapid and altered the character of the
national life of England to such a degree that it wrought untold
hardships for more than half a century.&nbsp; The people of the
villages were robbed of the barest means of making a
living.&nbsp; Just as today the small manufacture has no chance
against the big one in his line, so then the small landowner
could not compete against the wealthy ones, especially since new
and expensive machinery and fertilizers were becoming more and
more essential.&nbsp; The wealthy landowners improved their
estates so that they might raise the rent and make a profit that
could be compared to the profit made by the fast-rising merchant
aristocracy.&nbsp; The rent on these improved farms was so high
that the small farmer had to give up farming altogether.&nbsp;
The commons were enclosed and in a majority of the cases went to
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the wealthy
landowners who raised a better grade of sheep with heavier wool
on the pasturage thus afforded: but the small farmer and in fact
all the rest of the agricultural population did not have a place
to graze a cow.&nbsp; The small sum of money given them for the
loss of their rights in grazing stock on the commons and
gathering wood from the waste, was soon spent for the bare
necessities of living; and when this was spent, the economic
independence of the laboring population was gone.</p>
<p>The enclosures were thus fatal to three classes of the rural
population: the small farmer, who had at most thirty acres; the
cotter or cottager, who had perhaps five; and the laborer who had
less than that or none.&nbsp; The process of enclosing their
allottments after the consolidation mentioned, was so expensive
that it could not be borne except by a man with some capital to
start on.&nbsp; The man who was called upon by the enclosing
committee to promptly ditch and fence his little land, and who
could not do so, was compelled to sell at whatever price he could
get.&nbsp; The small farmer of thirty acres might possibly have
borne this expense but he received no adequate recompense for his
rights of common; and such advantages as he received from the
consolidation of his thirty acres could not make amends for the
loss of common rights.&nbsp; For, without pasture he could not
keep sheep; with no sheep he could not fertilize his land;
without fertilizer the land soon wore out.&nbsp; The small farmer
then could emigrate to America, or go to an industrial town, or
become a day laborer.&nbsp; Thus it was that a small, independent
farmer in a <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>few years became a laborer and in another few years was
perhaps thrown upon parish relief.</p>
<p>The effect upon the cottager can best be described by saying
that before the enclosures he was a laborer with land; and after
the enclosure he was a laborer without land.&nbsp; For the
inability to fence and ditch his holdings operated even more
sternly in his case than in that of the small farmer.&nbsp; A
great part of the land, moreover, that was enclosed was turned to
pasture by the large owners, and the laborers formerly employed
on it were discharged.&nbsp; Where fifteen men farmed, one man
herded.&nbsp; The cottager and the laborer were thus made
dependent on wages alone at a time when competition for work was
beating wages down to a starvation level.&nbsp; The squatter was
a poor alien on the land.&nbsp; He settled on the waste, built a
cottage, and got together a few geese, perhaps a cow and a horse;
and began to cultivate the land.&nbsp; With the coming of the
enclosure he lost his common right; and thus uprooted he could
start on a wandering journey of beggary.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can get an idea of the misery and universal
wretchedness of the rural population if we quote a few words from
an eye-witness, Cobbett, in his <span class="smcap">Parish
Register</span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Their dwellings are little better than
pig-beds; and the looks would indicate that their food is not
nearly the equal of that of a nig.&nbsp; The wretched hovels are
stuck upon little plots of ground by the road-side where the
space was wider than the road demanded.&nbsp; . . . Yesterday
morning was a sharp frost; and this had set the poor creatures
digging up their little plots of potatoes.&nbsp; In my whole life
I never saw <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>such wretchedness, not even among the plantation
negroes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The laborer, to keep from starving, often turned to poaching
and petty thievery.&nbsp; But the noblemen had their parks
enclosed against trespassers.&nbsp; Spring-guns were set up on
the estates.&nbsp; Poaching offenses were made punishable by
death, or at the least by transportation to Australia.&nbsp; The
poor might seek charity from the parish pauper work-house.&nbsp;
Or they might starve.</p>
<p>Many reforms to better these conditions were proposed, mainly
because the English Aristocracy had just seen in a sister nation
what a desperate proletariat could do if pushed to extremes of
misery.&nbsp; The reform that was adopted goes under the name of
<i>The Speenhamland System</i>.&nbsp; In brief, it provided that
if a laborer did not receive a certain minimum wage (which was
set on a sliding scale to correspond to the price of wheat), he
was to be given from the parish relief to make up the set
amount.&nbsp; Nothing was done to force the employer to pay this
minimum wage; and since he could depend upon the parish having to
pay it, he seldom did give the laborer a living wage.&nbsp; The
result was that those who were not already paupers speedily
became so.&nbsp; The scheme was the culmination of a series of
strokes that pauperized an already impoverished nation.</p>
<p>The laborer was separated from the land by the enclosures in a
greater degree than can be readily realized.&nbsp; Before the
industrial and agrarian revolutions, Arthur Young estimated that
out of a population of 8,500,000, the agricultural portion was
2,800,000, or one-fourth of the total number.&nbsp; In the <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>second decade
of the nineteenth century the total number engaged of farms and
dairies was 1,300,000: that is not half the actual number engaged
in the century before; while the proportion had sunk from one
person in four to one in twenty-five.</p>
<p>The main features of this land change were; the open field
system was abolished; the plow and grazing lands were enclosed;
small farms were consolidated into larger ones; new methods and
machinery were introduced; and the laborer was separated from the
land.&nbsp; It was in this change of rural conditions that the
poet John Clare was born and reared&mdash;in Northamptonshire,
which was a purely agricultural district and felt the misery and
universal pauperization that went with the agrarian
revolution.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>PART
II<br />
The Life Of John Clare (1793&ndash;1864)</h2>
<p>John Clare was horn in the little village of Helpstone in
Northamptonshire, in 1793.&nbsp; His family, one of the poorest
in the village, was enrolled in the parish pauper list.&nbsp;
When the poet was seven, his father by the greatest privations
sent him to a certain &ldquo;Dame-School&rdquo;; but the money
could not be spared to keep him there very long, and John was
hired out to tend the geese and sheep on the commons.&nbsp; He
saved up his few pennies during the next two or three years; and
again, at the age of ten, went to school for a few months.&nbsp;
This was all the formal education that the poet received; for at
twelve he was already working regularly in the fields.&nbsp; With
hardly strength enough for the slightest labor, so small and
weak-armed that his father made him a special flail to thresh
with, he must have endured sufferings of body and spirit those
years.</p>
<p>When he was thirteen, the reading of Thomson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Seasons&rdquo; led him to believe that he was a poet
himself.&nbsp; He had already showed a poetic temperament: as a
very young child he had set out one day to walk towards the
horizon, that he might touch it.&nbsp; As he grew older he was
unusually credulous of supernatural things, fancying all kinds of
ghosts and goblins in the swamps ready to attack him.&nbsp; Then,
when he read the &ldquo;Seasons&rdquo;, he scribbled down on a
piece of paper the lines which were afterwards known as
&ldquo;The <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Morning Walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote other verses on
scraps of paper which he would stuff into a hole in the
wall.&nbsp; When his mother would find them, she used them for
lighting the fires.&nbsp; The poet showed some of his verses to a
Mr. Thomas Porter living near Helpstone, and was advised to learn
grammar.&nbsp; The attempt to do this kept him from writing any
more poems for several years.</p>
<p>During these years, Clare engaged in various forms of day
labor to support himself.&nbsp; For a time he worked among the
gardeners in Burghley Park, where he acquired the habit of
carousing and drinking.&nbsp; He ran away for a few months but
after wandering about, went back home to work on a farm.&nbsp;
Later he found work at a lime-kiln; where, though the work was
hard, he found time to write half a dozen poems in the course of
a day.&nbsp; It was at this time, in 1817, that he met Martha
Turner, the &ldquo;Patty&rdquo; of some of his poems, whom he
married after many hesitations and differences.</p>
<p>Between the meeting with Patty and his marriage, three years
later, Clare became almost a beggar, and put down his name, as
his father did, on the pauper list, claiming relief from the
parish.&nbsp; The money he had saved when he worked at the
line-kiln had been spent on the printing of a hundred copies of a
prospectus, which he called: &ldquo;Proposals for Publishing by
Subscriptions a Collection of Original Trifles on Miscellaneous
Subjects, Religious and Moral, in Verse, by John Clare of
Helpstone.&rdquo;&nbsp; He intended to raise money on this
subscription and get married.&nbsp; As the title might indicate,
only seven subscribers <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>could be found; and it seemed as if
the poems would never be printed.&nbsp; But by good luck they
fell into the hands of a Stamford bookseller called Drury, who
sent them to London to his relative, Mr. Taylor, a prominent
printer.&nbsp; Taylor saw the value of the poems, and announced
them in the first issue of his new &ldquo;London
Magazine&rdquo;.&nbsp; On January 16, 1820, he published the
&ldquo;Poems Descriptive of Rural Life, and Scenery, by John
Clare, a Northamptonshire Peasant.&rdquo;&nbsp; He attached an
introduction that was almost an appeal to charity.</p>
<p>The success of the poems was immediate.&nbsp; Praise came from
the Quarterly Review that had attacked Keats.&nbsp; Madame
Vestris recited some of the poems at Covent Gardens; Rossini set
one of them to music.&nbsp; The poet was taken to London under
the guidance of his editor, Mr. Taylor, who took him to theatres
and dinner parties.&nbsp; There, because of his naive rusticity
in dress, manner, and speech, he became as popular as his rural
verses.&nbsp; At his first visit, he gained the friendship of two
life-long friends, Lord Radstock and Mrs. Emmerson.&nbsp;
Subscriptions were raised; the money was invested for him; and
Clare found himself with an income of forty-five pounds a
year.</p>
<p>On that amount the poet thought he could live without
working.&nbsp; In the day he would wander about the commons
writing poems; at night he sat in the inn-parlors receiving his
admirers.&nbsp; In 1821 he brought out another book, &ldquo;The
Village Minstrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gilchrist and Taylor <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>had fought
the battles of the first volume; but Gilchrist at this time was
busily engaged in a literary battle between the editors of Pope
and Byron and the Quarterly Review.&nbsp; This second volume of
Clare&rsquo;s was left neglected.&nbsp; The next year he made a
second trip to London.&nbsp; The poet stayed there long enough to
get acquainted with the taverns and gay theatres, and to fall in
love with an actress and the young wife of a friend.&nbsp; He met
Gifford and Murray, and supped with Lamb.</p>
<p>The freedom and gaiety of London had done Clare no good when
he came back to Helpstone; the trip had merely made him
discontented and lonely.&nbsp; However, he wrote verses copiously
and tried to make better bargains in selling them.&nbsp; He was
not successful at this, and the little money he had soon dwindled
away.&nbsp; Stinting himself in food that his ever increasing
family and old parents might have enough to eat, he became
seriously ill.&nbsp; He went to London again, and receiving
medical aid, became better rapidly.</p>
<p>On this visit, he met all the leading literary men as they
gathered for dinner parties at the home of the editor,
Taylor.&nbsp; Mr. Martin, Clare&rsquo;s biographer, gives the
poet&rsquo;s naive reaction to the &ldquo;Lions&rdquo; on the
times.&nbsp; Like a child he sat spell-bound listening to their
talk, while he felt keenly a disappointment that they were not as
he had imagined them in his day-dreams.&nbsp; At such parties he
met Hazlitt, Reynolds, Coleridge, Lamb, Cary, the translator of
Dante, and many others notables.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>As soon
as he was strong enough and had returned to Helpstone, he got a
job digging ditches and draining marshes; but he was too weak to
do the work.&nbsp; Sickness, poverty, cares, came faster and
faster.&nbsp; His thoughts naturally came to him in verse; but
the circumstances of his life prevented him from developing to
the extent he otherwise might.&nbsp; Sometimes his poverty and
his cares, sometimes drink, sometimes starvation, prevented him
from writing at all.&nbsp; Out under the open sky he felt
free.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was a favorite spot where he delighted
to sit, and where the hallowed vein of poetry flowed
freely.&nbsp; This spot was the hollow oak on the border of
Helpstone heath, called Lea Close Oak.&nbsp; Few human beings
ever came to this place; inside this oak the poet used to sit for
hours in silent meditations, forgetting everything about him and
unmindful of the waning day and the mantle of darkness falling
over the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Martin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of John
Clare.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>A few years of prosperity relieved the ever-oppressed,
poverty-cramped life of the poet.&nbsp; During these few years
there was scarcely a wish left unfulfilled, save the one of
wanting a strip of earth and to be king of his own land.&nbsp; A
poor crop and more sickness brought him back into the dire want
of his former years.&nbsp; The Earl Fitzwilliam gave him a few
acres of land and a small cottage; but the change from the spot
where he had always lived was more than he could bear, and signs
of approaching insanity became more <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>noticeable.&nbsp; The Earl proposed
to send him to an asylum, since it was decided that the poet had
lost his mind.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor with some interested friends
arranged to send him to a private asylum managed by a Dr. Allen,
at High Bridge.&nbsp; Homesickness for his wife and children made
him run away, after he had been at High Bridge for four years,
treated with the utmost kindness.&nbsp; His experiences on this
journey, as described afterwards in a letter, were of the most
pathetic kind.&nbsp; For ninety hours he had nothing to eat, save
a few tobacco crumbs he had found in his pocket and the green
grass by the roadside.&nbsp; Dying on the road from hunger, with
bruised and bleeding feet, he was picked up on the roadside by
his wife.&nbsp; Two county physicians came and signed the
certificate that was to shut him up in the Northamptonshire
Insane Asylum for the remaining twenty-two years of his life.</p>
<p>At this place Clare was treated with the utmost respect.&nbsp;
The officials placed him in a ward with the private patients,
paying honor to him as well as to themselves by recognizing the
poet in the pauper.&nbsp; In a recess in one of the big windows,
he spent the greater part of the years, writing and
thinking.&nbsp; When he became very weak and infirm, he was
wheeled about in the gardens.&nbsp; On Friday May 20, 1864 he
died.&nbsp; The superintendent of the asylum wrote to the Earl
Fitzwilliam for the small sum necessary to carry out the wish of
the poet that he be buried in his native soil.&nbsp; The Earl
refused; but some kind friends raised the sum.&nbsp; Clare now
lies under a broad sycamore tree <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>in the little cemetery of Helpstone,
&ldquo;with nothing above but the green grass and the eternal
vault of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

III<br />
Country Life in the Poetry of John Clare</h2>
<p>Although John Clare was a peasant suffering from poverty all
his life, his poetry was not written with a propagandistic but
with an artistic purpose.&nbsp; The literature of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries dealing with country life was either
artistic or social in purpose.&nbsp; Ebenezer Elliott, living at
the sane time as Clare, wrote poems with a social
purpose&mdash;for the repeal of the Corn Laws, and the lowering
of the import duties on raw material.&nbsp; Although Elliott was
actually benefitted by the Corn Laws, yet he wrote against them
most bitterly.&nbsp; John Clare, on the other hand, impoverished
all his life by the Corn Laws and other similar measures, wrote
nothing dealing with a change in the agricultural
situation.&nbsp; Both writers are to be praised for their
honesty, for their ability to detach themselves from immediate
personal interests, and for their fidelity to their artistic and
social purposes.</p>
<p>The poems of Clare may be divided into three classes: the Love
Poems, the Nature Poems, and the Poems dealing with social
life.&nbsp; In all the poet&rsquo;s writings he is dominated by
an artistic purpose rather than by a desire to reform or <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>change
conditions.&nbsp; We should expect this to be so in the Love
Poems, which form the bulk of his work.&nbsp; Yet, we may learn
something of the country life from these poems, if we take them,
written by a peasant as they are, to be typical of the sentiments
felt by all the rural laborers.&nbsp; In spite of the material
hardships and privations, there is a simplicity and sweetness in
the peasant&rsquo;s love, an inner life of tender emotions and
warmth of feeling, that is in stark contrast with external
hardships.&nbsp; Clare, in the love poems, expresses these
sentiments of the peasant.&nbsp; The poem best illustrating the
simple love is one entitled, &ldquo;My Love, thou art a Nosegay
Sweet.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And when, my Nosegay, thou shalt die,<br />
And heaven&rsquo;s flower shall prove thee;<br />
My hopes shall follow to the sky,<br />
And everlasting love thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ballad entitled &ldquo;William and Mary,&rdquo; <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> in which two rural swains are talking
of their sweethearts, shows an elevated emotion and respect for
the objects of their love, that is deep felt and natural.</p>
<blockquote><p>I strive to please her morning, noon, and
night.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
For her in harvest when the nuts are brown,<br />
I take my crook to pull the branches down.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
The garland and the wreath for her I bind<br />
Compos&rsquo;d of all the fairest flowers I find.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, a few lines showing the simplicity of the
peasant&rsquo;s imagery and comparisons.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&rsquo;Tis Spring, my Love, &rsquo;tis Spring,<br />
And the birds begin to sing;<br />
If it were winter, left alone with you,<br />
Your bonny form and face,<br />
Would make a Summer place,<br />
And be the fairest flower that ever grew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the sweet and simple love-life of the peasants, the
poet expresses their thoughts about the beauties of nature.&nbsp;
Nature must have afforded delights that did much to make up for
the poverty of the peasant&rsquo;s lack of material
comfort.&nbsp; Clare expresses these delights of the inarticulate
peasants when he describes their sentiments, as well as the
beauties of their native scenes.</p>
<blockquote><p>O Native endearments!&nbsp; I would not forsake
thee,<br />
I would not forsake thee for sweetest of scenes.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
Your skies may be gloomy, and misty your mornings,<br />
Your flat swampy vallies unwholesome may be;<br />
Still, refuse of nature without her adornings,<br />
Thou art dear as this heart in my bosom to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet finds beauty in the common, ordinary, natural objects
of the low fen and the marshy country of his birth.&nbsp; But in
these scenes he saw only the less gloomy and oppressive
aspects.&nbsp; The commons may have been brown and barren, but
Clare remembers them when they were green and dotted with wild
flowers.&nbsp; He wrote with fancy, feeling, and reflection about
these simple objects of nature.&nbsp; In his fancy he lived the
life of insects, which to many are simply annoyances, but which
to him are fairies, with colored hoods and burnished wings,
disguised in a sort of splendid masquerade, rocked to sleep in
the smooth velvet of the hedge-rose, or slumbering like princes
in the heath&rsquo;s purple hood, secure from rain, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>from dropping
dews, in their beds and painted walls.&nbsp; A jolly and royal
life this seems, this life of a hand of play-fellows mocking the
sunshine with their glittering wings, or drinking golden wine and
metheglin from the cup of the honey flower.&nbsp; In a reflective
mood, he sees into the eternal mysteries of nature, beneath the
forms and symbols of outward appearances.&nbsp; Cowslips of
golden blooms will come and go as fresh two thousand years from
now as they are today.&nbsp; Brooks, bees, birds, from age to
age, these will sing when all the ambitious things of earth have
passed away.</p>
<p>There are two characteristics in the nature poems of Clare:
truth in the painting of the objects, and tenderness in his
sentiments toward them.&nbsp; The poet is both truthful and
tender when he paints a bird&rsquo;s nest, a nest often seen but
never disturbed.&nbsp; The nest of the pettichaps, close to the
rut-galled wagon-road, so snugly contrived, although without a
clump of grass to keep it warm or a shielding thistle spreading
its spear in protection, is built like an oven. . . .</p>
<blockquote><p>Scarcely admitting two fingers in,<br />
Hard to discern the bird&rsquo;s snug entrance win:<br />
&rsquo;Tis lined with feathers warm as silken stole,<br />
Softer than seats of down for painless ease,<br />
And full of eggs, scarce bigger e&rsquo;en than peas;<br />
Here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s delicate, with spots so small<br />
As dust, and of a faint and pinky red;<br />
Well, let them be, and Safety guard them well&mdash;<br />
A green grasshopper&rsquo;s jump might break the shell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other objects of nature that delighted the peasants, and
were poetised by Clare were ants, clover blossoms, and perhaps an
early butterfly.&nbsp; Again, we find an intimacy with the furry
animals of the commons.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>And the little clumbling mouse<br />
Gnarls the dead leaves for her house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other poet has such a collection of insects and
animals.</p>
<blockquote><p>The little gay moth lovely to view<br />
A-dancing with lily-white wings in the dew;<br />
He whisked o&rsquo;er the water-edge flirting and airy<br />
And perched on the down-headed grass like a fairy.<br />
And there came the snail from shell peeping out,<br />
As cautious and fearful as thieves in the rout.<br />
The sly jumping frog, too, had ventured to ramp,<br />
And the glow-worm had just &rsquo;gun to light up his lamp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we can get an idea of the country life from the love
poems, which showed the tender emotional love-life of the
laborer, in spite of his mental poverty and material
hardships.&nbsp; Likewise, in the nature poems, the poet shows
the beauties of nature in the country.&nbsp; The peasant
delighted in these beauties; he is rich in poetic sentiments and
intimate observations, though he is poor&mdash;if we judge
poverty to be a lack of food and clothing.&nbsp; If the Poet had
any resentment of the social and economic situation, we should
expect to find it in the poems dealing with Social Life.</p>
<p>Crabbe&rsquo;s lines in the &ldquo;Village&rdquo;, that
describe a boy fainting in the fields from exhaustion, are
memorable.&nbsp; Such lines might have come aptly from Clare, who
as a laborer, fainted from exhaustion and hunger, and often went
without food.&nbsp; These lines of Crabbe&rsquo;s are exactly
descriptive of the miseries of the poor, as experienced by Clare
himself.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He strives to join his fellows in the field,<br />
Till long-contending nature droops at last.<br />
Declining health rejects the poor repast.<br />
His cheerless spouse the coming anger sees,<br />
And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>However
we never find a trace of bitterness in the poems of social life
written by Clare.&nbsp; Instead, he describes the hay-making time
in this manner:</p>
<blockquote><p>And meadows, they are mad with noise<br />
Of laughing maids and shouting boys,<br />
Making up the withering hay<br />
With merry hearts as light as play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All his life the poet longed for a spot of ground of his own;
but enclosures made this an impossibility.&nbsp; Yet, when Clare
wrote about enclosures, it is not about a personal wrong or
injustice that he speaks; but about the loss of beauty or of
something dear to his heart that had been, but now was gone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever I must along the Plain,<br />
And mark where once they grew,<br />
Remembrance wakes her busy train,<br />
And brings past scenes to view.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
The green&rsquo;s gone, too&mdash;ah, lovely scene!<br />
No more the kingcup gay<br />
Shall shine in yellow o&rsquo;er the green.<br />
And shed its golden ray;<br />
No more the herdsman&rsquo;s early call<br />
Shall bring the cows to feed;<br />
No more the milk-maid&rsquo;s evening brawl<br />
In &ldquo;Come Mull&rdquo; tones succeed.</p>
<p>Both milk-maid&rsquo;s shouts and herdsman&rsquo;s call<br />
Have vanished from the green;<br />
The kingcup&rsquo;s yellow, shade and all,<br />
Shall never more be seen;<br />
But the thick-cultur&rsquo;d tribe that grow<br />
Will so efface the scene,<br />
That aftertime will hardly know<br />
It ever was a green.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this same connection, in the &ldquo;Village
Minstrel,&rdquo; we find these lines lamenting the absence of old
scenes and objects of beauty that are gone.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>There once were springs, when daisies&rsquo; silver
studs<br />
Like sheets of snow on every pasture spread;<br />
There once were summers where the crow-flower buds<br />
Like golden sunbeams that sheltered Lubin&rsquo;s head;<br />
There fallen trees the naked moors bewail,<br />
And scarce a bush is left to the tell the mournful tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the poet never wrote to reform agricultural
conditions, he is often realistic.&nbsp; He even denounces them
occasionally, but his prevailing tone is lamentation&mdash;for
the passing of the meadow-blooms and pasture-flowers&mdash;for
the trimmed hedge-fences and well-kept lawns.</p>
<blockquote><p>Enclosures came and every path was stopt.<br />
Each tyrant fix&rsquo;d his sign where paths were found<br />
To hint a trespass who might cross the ground.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
But who can tell the anguish of his mind,<br />
When reformation&rsquo;s formidable foes<br />
With civil wars &rsquo;gainst nature&rsquo;s peace combined,<br
/>
And desolation struck her deadly blows<br />
As curst improvement &rsquo;gan his fields inclose;<br />
Oh greens, and fields, and trees, farewell, farewell!<br />
His heart-wrung pains, his unavailing woes<br />
No words can utter, and no tongue can tell,<br />
When ploughs destroy&rsquo;d the green, when groves of willow
fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clare sees the hut of clay where the widow lives; he sees the
poor house, and feels the sting that must be the feeling of the
pauper when he accepts charity from the parish.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yon parish-hut, where want is shov&rsquo;d to
die,<br />
He never views them but his tear would start;<br />
He passed not by the doors without a sigh,<br />
And felt for every woe of work-house misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither does the old dame at the parish cottage, as she stands
in the door viewing the children play, and remembering her past
youth&mdash;neither does she escape the poet&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>She turns from echoes of her younger years<br />
And nips the portion of her snuff with tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet sees another old woman gathering cress, to make a
savory salad for Luxury&rsquo;s whim.&nbsp; For her labor the old
woman will get a penny and a frown.&nbsp; These objects of nature
were just as natural for Clare to write about, as the brown
leaves falling in the autumn instead of the green leaves coming
out in the spring.&nbsp; The dismal as well as the sunny days,
the joys as well as the sorrows, he shews in his picture of the
country life.</p>
<p>However realistic the poet may be, he is dominated by his
artistic purpose; and for this purpose he chose scenes in the
country that amused or aroused tender emotions in him.&nbsp; He
shunned, perhaps sub-consciously, the things that brought up
feelings of there being injustice in the world.&nbsp; His
peasants never lack enough food, or some kind of a hut that they
call home.&nbsp; In the wood-cutter&rsquo;s cabin the
&ldquo;careful wife displays her frugal hoard, and both partake
in comfort though they are poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; His country
laborer, working on some enclosed farm, is a religious man, not
the drunken ignorant peasant who spends his few pennies at some
tavern while his wife and children starve.&nbsp; This laborer,
Clare depicts going out with his children on a Sunday
afternoon.</p>
<blockquote><p>And often takes his family abroad<br />
On short excursions o&rsquo;er the fields and plain<br />
Making each object on the road<br />
An insect, spring of grass, or ear of grain;<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Endeavoring thus most simply to maintain<br />
That the same power that bids the mite to crawl<br />
That browns the wheat-land in its summer stain,<br />
That power which formed the simple flower withal,<br />
Formed all that lives and grows upon this earthly ball.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clare writes that his purpose is not to lament the sorrows but
to show the joys; and we may take the dominant motive of the poet
from the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>But useless naming what distress reveals,<br />
As every child of want feels all that Lubin feels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with this purpose, in the &ldquo;Village
Minstrel&rdquo;, his longest poem, he gives us a variegated
picture of idyllic country life.</p>
<p>In the Spring the country hums with new life.&nbsp; On his way
to plow the fields, the peasant feels the Spring-time in the air;
the birds sing merrily as they build their nests; the
blue-meadow-daisy peeps farther out from the grass; while the
white lambs grazing on the green commons look like the last
remnants of the winter&rsquo;s snow.&nbsp; The milk-maid hums a
love song as she weaves a garland to crown the first returning
cow.&nbsp; The housewives gossip about the hens and the geese;
while on Sunday after church the men talk about the good and the
bad signs of the weather for the growing grain.</p>
<p>Then the Spring passes into summer, with its gentle, quiet
breezes.&nbsp; A droning insect disturbed by a shrill sound of
the hay-maker&rsquo;s scythe ceases for a moment his course; a
butterfly rests on a stalk and is swayed to and fro by the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>breeze.&nbsp;
The laborer, returning home in the long summer twilight,
remembers the ghost stories told the past winter; and as the
night comes on he hears the swashing sound of the drowned
Amy&rsquo;s boots.&nbsp; Mid-summer is ushered in with its feast,
and every heart is jumping with joy.&nbsp; In brand-new clothes
the swain goes to the place of merriment, eager to meet his
sun-tanned lass.&nbsp; The woodsman and the thresher, children
and kin from the neighboring village, are all present.&nbsp; At
the cotter&rsquo;s house, Joe tunes his fiddle for the
dance.&nbsp; When the fiddler is paid, the place is cleared for
the merry games that follow the feast.</p>
<blockquote><p>Great sport for them was jumping in a sack,<br />
For beaver hat bedecked in ribbons blue;<br />
Soon one jumps down though he&rsquo;s broke his neck<br />
And tries to rise and wondrous sport they make,<br />
And monstrous fun it makes to hunt the pig;<br />
As soapt and larded through the crowd he flies.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . . . . . . . . . . .<br />
And badger-baiting here, and fighting cocks&mdash;<br />
And wrestlers join to tug each other down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At night the men go to the ale-house to drink, smoke, and make
merry until the money&rsquo;s all gone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Resolv&rsquo;d to keep it merry while it&rsquo;s
here<br />
As toil comes every day and feasts but once a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Autumn, with corn gleanings and merry tales, brings its joy
and feasts.&nbsp; As the old women gather the last of the
harvest, they get over-heated.&nbsp; Stopping to catch their
breath, they amuse the children with stories or Jack the
Giant-Killer, Cincerilla, and Thumbs.&nbsp; When the harvest work
is done, another feast, known as the Harvest-Supper,
follows.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Beer, smoking, and harmless pranks usher out the season
of mists and mellow fruitfulness.</p>
<p>Autumn breezes turn into sharper and more stinging blasts; the
moors and leas grow bare; the trees are stript of leaves; winter
is come.&nbsp; Though sombre and desolate, the peasant delights
in watching the storm, as great clouds float faster and faster as
the wind drives them before it.&nbsp; The woodsman, returning
home on a winter night with a load of fire-wood, looks like a
moving snow-bank.&nbsp; The supper is ready stewing on the hook;
the children, bright-eyed with happiness, prattle about his knees
to welcome him home.&nbsp; After supper with the hearth swept
clean, stories, songs, and prayer end the day.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;And thus in
wedlock&rsquo;s joy the laborer drowns his care.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
